    />\n    <h2>Step 1</h2>\n\n    In a large bowl, combine the sugar, butter, cream
    cheese, salt, almond and vanilla extracts, and egg yolk. Beat until smooth. Stir
    in flour until well blended. Chill the dough for 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat
    oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\n\n    <h2>Step 2</h2>\n\n    On a lightly
    floured surface, roll out the dough 1/3 at a time to 1/8 inch thickness, refrigerating
    remaining dough until ready to use. Cut into desired shapes with lightly floured
    cookie cutters. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Leave cookies plain
    for frosting, or brush with slightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with candy
    sprinkles or colored sugar.\n\n    <h2>Step 3</h2>\n\n    Bake for 7 to 10 minutes
    in the preheated oven, or until light and golden brown. Cool cookies completely
    before frosting.\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n"
